#  Labrinth 
is a Python-based maze generation and solving tool. It uses algorithms to create and navigate mazes, providing a visual representation of both the labyrinth and the pathfinding process.

Features
Maze Generation: Randomly generates mazes using various algorithms (e.g., recursive backtracking).
Maze Solving: Implements pathfinding algorithms to find solutions to the maze.
Visualization: Displays the maze and solution path for easy interpretation.
Technologies
Python 3.x
Tkinter (for GUI visualization)
Random module (for maze generation)
